## 🚀 What is Job Tinder?

Job Tinder bridges the gap between traditional job portals and the short attention span of modern users.

We built a mobile-first platform that lets users **discover and apply to jobs with a single swipe**. Each listing is AI-enhanced, summarized, and personalized — cutting through clutter and helping candidates focus on what actually matters.

Whether you're a college student or a recruiter, Job Tinder delivers a smoother, faster, and more engaging hiring experience.
